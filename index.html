					Two blocks of tests, one for cognitive domains (motor ability, attention, and executive function) and the second for mood and QOL, were carried out in a group of older adults (61–84 years old; n = 13) that for 4 months received piano classes and practiced for 45 min/day against a control group (63–80 years old; n = 16) that had done other kind of leisure activities. We have found significant improvements following the piano training in some tests that measure attention and executive function (Stroop and a trend in TMT-A). Moreover, we also observe a significant improvement in affective states (BDI and POMS) and some domains of QOL (WHOQOL-BREF).

					HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.
					<br>
					We've come a long way since HTML could barely handle a simple page layout. HTML5 can be used to write web applications that still work when you're not connected to the net; to tell websites where you are physically located; to handle high definition video; and to deliver extraordinary graphics.

			<h1>Should You Eat Red Meat?</h1>
			<p>Another diet study, another controversy and the public is left wondering what to make of it. This time it's a series of studies in the Annals of Internal Medicine by an international group of researchers concluding people need not reduce their consumption of red and processed meat.

			<h1>Vegetables and Fruits</h1>
			<p>A diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, prevent some types of cancer, lower risk of eye and digestive problems, and have a positive effect upon blood sugar, which can help keep appetite in check. Eating non-starchy vegetables and fruits like apples, pears, and green leafy vegetables may even promote weight loss. [1] Their low glycemic loads prevent blood sugar spikes that can increase hunger.
